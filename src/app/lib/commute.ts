const commute: string[] = [
    "Spidey Shuttle: Hop on the local spider express! It’s free, if you don't count the cost of potentially being wrapped in silk and saved for a late-night snack.",

    "Walk of Doom: Stretch those legs and take a stroll. It’s great exercise—just try to outrun the arachnid army hot on your trail. Running shoes recommended!",
    
    "Hoverboard Hijinks: For the thrill-seeker, grab a hoverboard and glide over the webbed streets. Perfect for the hover enthusiast who's not afraid of the occasional eight-legged hitchhiker.",
    
    "Teleportation Trap: Use the latest in alien tech to teleport to your work-from-home station. Just a small chance you'll materialize inside a giant spider den—exciting!",
    
    "Web Way: Embrace the chaos and swing from spider web to spider web like an alien Spiderman. Sure, you might get caught, but hey, nothing says commitment like showing up to work cocooned.",
